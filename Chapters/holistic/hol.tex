Great database systems performance relies heavily on index tuning, i.e., creating and utilizing 
the best indices depending on the workload. 
However, the complexity of the index tuning process has dramatically increased in recent years
 due to ad-hoc workloads and shortage of time and system resources to invest in tuning.

This paper introduces \emph{holistic indexing}, a new approach 
to automated index tuning in dynamic environments.
Holistic indexing requires zero set-up and tuning effort, relying on adaptive index creation as 
a side-effect of query processing. Indices are created incrementally and partially;
they are continuously refined as we process more and more queries.
Holistic indexing takes the state-of-the-art adaptive indexing ideas a big step further
by introducing the notion of a system which never stops refining the index space, taking educated decisions
about which index we should incrementally refine next based on continuous knowledge acquisition 
about the running workload and resource utilization. 
When the system detects idle CPU cycles,  it utilizes those extra cycles by refining the adaptive indices
which are most likely to bring a benefit for future queries. 
Such idle CPU cycles occur when the system cannot exploit all available cores up to 100\%, 
i.e., either because the workload is not enough to saturate the CPUs
or because the current tasks performed for 
query processing are not easy to parallelize to the point where all available CPU power is exploited.  
 
In this paper, we present the design of  holistic indexing 
for column-oriented database architectures and we discuss a detailed analysis
against parallel versions of state-of-the-art indexing and adaptive indexing approaches.
Holistic indexing is implemented in an open-source column-store DBMS.
Our detailed experiments on both synthetic and standard benchmarks (TPC-H) and workloads (SkyServer) demonstrate that holistic indexing
brings significant performance gains by being able to continuously refine the physical design 
in parallel to query processing, exploiting any idle CPU resources.
