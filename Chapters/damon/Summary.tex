\section{Summary}
\label{subsec:damon_conclusion}
\emph{CPU-efficient implementation of even simple algorithms is hard}:
while common knowledge in many fields of computer science, this
insight is still not properly appreciated in the field of data
management. In this paper, we conducted an in-depth study of such a
supposedly simple algorithm: pivoted partitioning. We demonstrated
that, in its na\"ive implementation, it is not an I/O bound
algorithm. Starting from this understanding, we systematically
analyzed and addressed the dominant cost factors using
state-of-the-art techniques. The result is in an implementation that
rivals and sometimes even outperforms a parallelized scan on a variety of
systems. In that, it is up to 25 times faster than the initial
